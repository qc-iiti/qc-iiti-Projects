# Grover's Algorithm Using Qiskit
Repo Link: [Click Here!](https://NEVERGONNAGIVEYOU.UP)
---
We simulated Grover's algorithm using Qiskit and the Aer Backend.
Grover's algorithm works by using an oracle that takes a superposition of states and selectively boosting amplitudes associated with the key.

Tech: `Qiskit` `Aer` `Python`
Contributors: `John Doe` `Jane Doe`
