# European Options Pricing via Quantum Differential Machine Learning
Repo Link: [Click Me!](https://github.com/arhamaneeq/iiti-qc-EuropeansOptionPricingViaQML.git)

This project replicates and extends the findings presented by T. Sakuma (2023), applying Quantum Machine Learning (QML) techniques to predict European call and put options prices.

## Key Principles

- `Black-Scholes`: A foundational mathematical model for pricing derivatives, used here to generate synthetic training data
- `European Options`: Financial contracts exercisable only at expiration, providing boundary conditions for the Black-Scholes partial differential equation.
- `Differential Machine Learning`: A machine learning framework where the loss function is defined in terms of both the model output and its derivatives, enhancing accuracy in learning dynamic systems.
- `Parameter Shift Rule`: A quantum computing technique enabling the exact evaluation of circuit gradients with respect to input parameters via controlled phase shifts.
- `Angle Embedding`: A method of encoding continuous classical data into quantum states by applying rotation gates.

## Features
 
- Synthetic data generation based on the Black-Scholes equation
- 2-qubit quantum neural network trained with angle-embedded input data and tunable weights
- Performance evaluation and analysis of the trained model
