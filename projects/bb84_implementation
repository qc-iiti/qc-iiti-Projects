# Quantum Key Distribution (BB84 Protocol)

**Repo Link:** [Click Me!](https://github.com/namanshetty25/Quantum-Key-Distribution)

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a secure communication method that uses quantum mechanics to enable two parties (commonly called Alice and Bob) to produce a shared, random secret key. This key can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages with guaranteed security against an eavesdropper (Eve).

This repository provides an implementation and simulation of QKD protocols (currently BB84) in Python, along with interactive GUI tools, Bloch sphere visualizations, and performance analysis plots.

## Key Principles

- **BB84 Protocol:**  
  A quantum cryptography protocol developed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984, enabling secure key distribution using quantum states.

- **Quantum Superposition:**  
  Utilizes qubits' ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously to encode cryptographic keys.

- **Quantum Measurement:**  
  Ensures security by collapsing quantum states upon measurement, detecting potential eavesdroppers.

- **No-Cloning Theorem:**  
  Prevents unauthorized copying of quantum states, ensuring the integrity of the key exchange.
