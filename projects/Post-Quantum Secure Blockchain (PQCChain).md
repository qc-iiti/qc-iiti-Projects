üõ°Ô∏è Post-Quantum Secure Blockchain (PQCChain)

Repo Link: Click Me!

Post-Quantum Secure Blockchain (PQCChain) is a prototype blockchain system that integrates CRYSTALS-Dilithium, a lattice-based digital signature scheme, to secure blockchain wallets and transactions against quantum attacks. By replacing traditional ECDSA with Dilithium, the system demonstrates how blockchain infrastructure can be made resilient to future quantum computing threats.

This repository provides an implementation and simulation of a quantum-resistant blockchain in Python, along with wallet management, transaction signing, block mining, and a frontend interface for interaction.

Key Principles

Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):
Uses lattice-based signatures standardized by NIST to resist attacks from quantum computers.

CRYSTALS-Dilithium:
A quantum-safe digital signature scheme based on module lattices, designed for efficiency, security, and resilience.

Blockchain Security:
Integrates Dilithium into wallet creation, transaction signing, and block validation.

Research-Oriented Prototype:
Demonstrates how next-generation blockchains can evolve to counter quantum threats.
